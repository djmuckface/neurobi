# Neurobi Homepage

This is the full homepage setup for Neurobi.

## Folder Structure:
- index.html — Main homepage file
- css/styles.css — Tailwind-based styles
- js/main.js — Placeholder for interactive elements
- assets/ — Contains logo and other images

## Instructions for Cursor:
1. Copy the entire folder into your project structure.
2. Open `index.html` to view the homepage.
3. Ensure Tailwind and icon libraries are loaded if building locally.
4. Customize or extend functionality using JS modules.

This build follows the structure that successfully loaded for Mintiq. Let me know if it still fails to load.
